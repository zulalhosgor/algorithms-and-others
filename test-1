Question: Write the stages of the given sequence iin following below according to the sort type.

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort


Answer:

[22,27,16,2,18,6] == n
[2,22,27,16,18,6] == n-1
[2,6,22,27,16,18] == n-2
[2,6,16,22,27,18] == n-3
[2,6,16,18,22,27] == 1

Big O Notation = n*(n+1)/2 =(n^2+n) / 2 = n^2
Big O Notation = n^2

Question:

Time Complexity: After the array is sorted, which of the following cases does the number 18 fall into?

Average case: in the middle.
Worst case: at the end of the given list.
Best case: at the beginning of the given list.



[2,6,16,18,22,27]

Since the number 18, which is the number we are looking for, is in the middle of the array; appropriate scope is "Average Case"

Question: Write the first 4 steps of the array given below a according to the Selection Sort.


[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] 
[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] n
[2,7,3,5,8,9,4,15,6] n-1
[2,3,7,5,8,9,4,15,6] n-2
[2,3,4,7,5,8,9,15,6] n-3
[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6] n-4
